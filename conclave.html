            <p class="game-description">Conclave aims to not only replicate the TTRPG experience, but also enhance it with a wide array of tools, effects, and atmospheric settings. It's never been easier to start a session; with just a single copy of Conclave, the whole party can play and create together whether local or online.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">WHAT IS CONCLAVE?</h2>
        
        <p>Conclave is a simple and intuitive way to take your TTRPG campaign to the next level, whether your group is playing in the same room or scattered across the realms.</p>
        <img src="Images/Gifs/adventurers.gif" alt="3D figures in Conclave" width="1000px">
        <p>Conclave isn't trying to be a video game, a content platform, or an all-in-one solution; Conclave is a table that you can share with your friends, near or far. Put down a map and some figures, and then you're ready to go.</p>
        <p>Conclave is all about the experience, not the numbers. There's no managing stats or fiddling with complex mazes of menus; we'll assume you've already got the character sheets covered. Instead, we aim to provide a customizable space with easy and straightforward tools for you to build and play out your sessions just like you would at the table.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">PROFICIENCIES</h2>
        
        <p>Conclave includes an array of tools to help you on your journey, including dice, measuring tools, status effects, and a fog painting system. We've included some assets to get you started, but this is your game; your story. Who are we to decide what's in it? You can quickly and easily import everything you need for your session: maps, tokens, portraits... even your own custom HeroForge minis!</p>
        <img src="Images/Gifs/time of day.gif" alt="Changing time of day in Conclave" width="1000px">
        <p>Change time of day, lighting, and even weather and nature effects to get the vibe you want. Conclave's minimalist design means it gets out of the way when you need it to so players can focus on the story and experience you're building together.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">COLLABORATIVE STORYTELLING</h2>
        <p>Conclave aims to not only replicate the classic tabletop gaming experience, but also enhance it, and make it easier than ever to get your group together. Conclave is built with local multiplayer in mind, so players in the same room can simply pass a controller or two around. Online players needn't worry though, as Conclave fully supports Steam's Remote Play Together service. With just a single copy of Conclave, the whole party can play and create together.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">HOUSE RULES</h2>
        
        <p>Conclave is designed primarily to facilitate tabletop RPGs, but there's no rule that says you can't branch out. If it involves moving pieces on a board, there's probably a good chance you can play it with Conclave.</p>
